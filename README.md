# ROW: Classifier of Room Occupancy using WIFI signals

The ability to ’see through walls’ has always been somewhat of a superpower required for various
tasks and needs. Tasks like indoor positioning for smart houses, counting stationary crowds (for
example, the number of people sitting in a large room), understanding different actions people are
doing in a closed room behind a wall, etc.
This repo is using RF (Radio Frequency) signals, specifically Wi-Fi signals, and apply modern techniques
to classify room occupancy.
